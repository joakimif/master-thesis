We are using Artificial Intelligence everywhere these days. Everyone is talking about how self-driving cars will change the world. Every smartphone company includes AI in their phones, striving to make the day of the user effortless. Thanks to Machine Learning or more specifically Deep Learning, AI can already beat humans in most games and do repetitive tasks for us. The concept of AI has been around for a long time (more than 80 years by among others Alan Turing \cite{turing1938}), but until 2012 Deep Learning was not a valid form of AI \cite{topol2019}. Today Deep Learning is widely used by the largest companies to learn all patterns possible about their customers. 

Research on the usage of AI in the medical field is particularly interesting, as the results can be life-changing. Instead of getting diagnosed only by a single doctor, a global AI will influence his or her decisions. The difference between independent doctors worldwide would not matter as much, and with high accuracy, doctors instantly would know a lot about the patient.

Depression is what these people share. Three hundred and fifty million people globally are fighting this burden \cite{burden_of_depression}, which in a lot of the cases does not end well for them. AI has enormous potential here to help with diagnoses, help in the process of prescribing the right medicine to patients and predict that a person is likely to attempt suicide \cite{topol2019}.
