\section{Bipolar disorder}

Bipolar disorder is the disorder where you experience extreme mood swings. One day you can feel amazing and everything is fine, but the next day
you feel like you don't belong anywhere in this universe. Mood swings in general is not something that you should be concerned about. It is however the extreme cases where 
your mind turns 180 degrees from day to day that is the main symptom of bipolar disorder. There is not really a specific type of people that get this; they can be 
of any age and any gender, but most people that suffer from it find out (by having an experience or episode) around age 25 \cite{bipolar_statistics}. 

When talking about bipolar disorder, we often separate between the states \emph{normal}, \emph{mania} and \emph{depression}. The last two are the states we usually talk about, 
since a normal state isn't that interesting. These two states are very different, but they have some similarities, for example sleeping problems. 

When a bipolar person is in a manic state, he/she may do things that they never would have intended doing, like spending a lot of money on items they really don't need, 
or abusing drugs/alcohol. They may also feel really excited or powerful \cite{bipolar_overview}. 

A bipolar patient is in a depressive state when he or she is in a bad mood swing. They can stop doing everything they usually like to do, and lie down in bed all day
with no motivation to do anything useful. They may feel useless and that they don't belong here, or being guilty of something they may or may not have done. In some cases, 
a depression may even end up with suicidality, where the person either just thinks of death, or actually attempt suicide (actually 20\% of people diagnosed with bipolarity 
commit suicide \cite{bipolar_statistics}). 

The frequency of these symptoms can vary. One year they can have these mood swings every day for several weeks at the time, 
and the next they get them less frequent, like once every month. 

We also separate between bipolar disorder type I and II, with the main difference being that the manic episodes are way more aggressive in type IÂ \cite{bipolar_types}.

Statistics say that bipolarity is genetically inheritable, with 23\% chance of getting a child with bipolar disorder if one parent is bipolar, and 66\% 
if both parents are \cite{bipolar_statistics}.
