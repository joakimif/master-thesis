I would like to thank PÃ¥l Halvorsen and Michael Riegler for being my supervisors. They have shown great skill in what they do at Simula and UiO, and their feedback and tips have been essential for the success of my thesis.

I would also like to thank my family and friends for motivating and always believing in me. It has been difficult at times to stay focused on a large project like this.

Thanks to the developers of Grammarly. Their software has kept my writing at a decent level.

My inner circle at IFI deserves a special thanks. We have been pushing each other through everything since day one, and we have now finished five years of education together.
