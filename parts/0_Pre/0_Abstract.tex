This thesis presents convolutional neural networks built to classify and predict three aspects of mental health. The dataset used contains motor activity measurements for each minute in the monitoring period for each participant. Models are trained to fit time-sliced segments of these measurements. The first model classifies whether a participant most likely belongs to the condition group (bipolar disorder or unipolar depressive) or the control group (non-depressed participants). We trained another model to classify the depression level of participants (divisions of MADRS scores), and finally, a model that predicts MADRS scores. Techniques like leave one participant out were performed to validate the performance of trained models, and we achieved an average F1-score of 0.70 for detecting control/condition group and 0.30 for detecting the depression levels \emph{normal}, \emph{mild} and \emph{moderate}.
